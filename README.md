In this notebook we will:
Use NumPy linear algebra package to find the solutions to the system of linear equations
Perform row reduction to bring matrix into row echelon form
Find the solution for the system of linear equations using row reduced matrix
Evaluate the determinant of the matrix
See the connection between matrix singularity and the number of solutions of the linear system
