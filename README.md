In this notebook we will:
1. Use NumPy linear algebra package to find the solutions to the system of linear equations
2. Perform row reduction to bring matrix into row echelon form
3. Find the solution for the system of linear equations using row reduced matrix
4. Evaluate the determinant of the matrix
5. See the connection between matrix singularity and the number of solutions of the linear system
